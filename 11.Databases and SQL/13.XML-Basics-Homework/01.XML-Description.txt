Extensible Markup Language (XML) is a markup language that defines a set of rules for 
encoding documents in a format that is both human-readable and machine-readable.
The design goals of XML emphasize simplicity, generality, and usability over the Internet.
It is a textual data format with strong support via Unicode for different human languages.
Many application programming interfaces (APIs) have been developed to aid software developers with processing XML data,
and several schema systems exist to aid in the definition of XML-based languages.

1.What database models do you know?
  - Hierarchical(tree),  Network / graph, Relational (table), Object-oriented
  
2.Which are the main functions performed by a Relational Database Management System (RDBMS)?
  - Creating / altering / deleting tables and relationships between them (database schema)
  - Adding, changing, deleting, searching and retrieving of data stored in the tables
  - Transaction management 
  
3.Define what is "table" in database terms.
  - Database tables consist of data, arranged in rows and columns
  - All rows have the same structure
  - Columns have name and type (number, string, date, image, or other)
  - The schema of a table is an ordered sequence of column specifications (name and type)

4.Explain the difference between a primary and a foreign key.
  - Primary key is a column of the table that uniquely identifies its rows (usually its is a number)
  - The foreign key is an identifier of a record located in another table (usually its primary key)

5.Explain the different kinds of relationships between tables in relational databases.
  - There is three types of relationships:
    - One-to-many
    - Many-to-many
    - One-to-one

6.When is a certain database schema normalized? What are the advantages of normalized databases?
  - Normalization of the relational schema removes repeating data
  - Advantages: 
    - we can save a lot of storage memory
	- the performance is better
	
7.What are database integrity constraints and when are they used?
  - Enforce data rules which cannot be violated
  - Ensures that the primary key of a table has unique value for each table row
  - Ensures that all values in a certain column (or a group of columns) are unique

8.Point out the pros and cons of using indexes in a database.
  - Indices speed up searching of values in a certain column or group of columns 
  - Adding and deleting records in indexed tables is slower!

9.What's the main purpose of the SQL language?
  - Standardized declarative language for manipulation of relational databases
  - Creating, altering, deleting tables and other objects in the database
  - Searching, retrieving, inserting, modifying and deleting table data (rows)

10.What are transactions used for? Give an example.
  - A bank transfer from one account into another (withdrawal + deposit).
  If either the withdrawal or the deposit fails the entire operation should be cancelled

11.What is a NoSQL database?
  - This is non-relational database.
  - using Schema-free document storage 
  - Highly optimized for append / retrieve

12.Explain the classical non-relational data models.
  - non-relational database uses document instead tables.
  
13.Give few examples of NoSQL databases and their pros and cons.
  - Redis
    - Ultra-fast in-memory data structures server
  - MongoDB
    - Mature and powerful JSON-document database
  - CouchDB
    - JSON-based document database with REST API

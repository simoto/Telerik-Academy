            /*A bank holds different types of accounts for its customers: deposit accounts, 
            loan accounts and mortgage accounts. Customers could be individuals or companies.

            All accounts have customer, balance and interest rate (monthly based). 
            Deposit accounts are allowed to deposit and with draw money. Loan and mortgage accounts can only deposit money.

            All accounts can calculate their interest amount for a given period (in months). 
            In the common case its is calculated as follows: number_of_months * interest_rate.

            Your task is to write a program to model the bank system by classes and interfaces.
            You should identify the classes, interfaces, base classes and abstract actions and implement
            the calculation of the interest functionality through overridden methods. */
